## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 
What do we need to install the software and how to install them. 
```
Give examples
```

### Installing 
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```
Give examples

### Keyboard Versions
We created 5 different versions of the keyboard as such there are 5 copies of XML files and Java files for each respective version. To learn how to access each individual file, see the next section 'Accessing Files from Android Studio'

1. DRAG AND DROP (RED): Drag and Drop Keyboard with Red letters because red is colour our client, Clovis, requests the most when he paints. 

2. DRAG AND DROP (BLACK): Drag and Drop Keyboard with Black letters has the same functions as the one with red letters

3. ONE SCROLLBAR: Typing Interface with a single scroll bar on the right

4. TWO SCROLLBAR + GRID + ANIMATION: Typing Interface with two scroll bars, a grid as the background canvas and animated letters. 

5. TWO SCROLLBAR: Typing Interface with only two scrollbars. 


### Accessing Files from Android Studio
* To access Java file with the code for the drag and drop keyboard, Select the following folders in order
```
Clovis_prototype_01 --> app --> src --> main --> java/com/example/mdhwang/clovis_prototyp --> DraggingRed.java 
```

* To access the XML file with the code that defines the user interface of the keyboard, Select the following folders in order
```
Clovis_prototype_01 --> app --> src --> main --> res --> layout --> activity_dragging_red.xml
```

### Application Features 
* From the homepage, select "Drag and Drop (Final)"
* To select different letters, tap on the left or right button icons on the top left and top right corners of the screen respectively
* To begin typing, tap on the letters with your finger and drag it into the white space in the center. You can drag the letters around the white space thereafter. 
* To delete a selected letter, drag it to the image of Oscar the Grouch. 
* To clear all the letters, click on the 'Clear' button on the bottom right corner of the screen.
